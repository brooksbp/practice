`ad hoc' problems are those whose algorithms do not fall into standard
categories with well-studied solutions.

The solutions might require a novel data structure or an unusual set of
loops or conditionals.

Ad hoc problems can still require reasonable optimizations and at least a
degree of analysis that enables on eto avoid loops nested five deep, for
example.
